    "# Generative AI Use Case: Summarize Dialogue\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the practical side of this course. In this lab you will do the dialogue summarization task using generative AI. You will explore how the input text affects the output of the model, and perform prompt engineering to direct it towards the task you need. By comparing zero shot, one shot, and few shot inferences, you will take the first step towards prompt engineering and see how it can enhance the generative output of Large Language Models."
